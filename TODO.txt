Fix circular peer info pinging


To Make your daemon accessible to other for sharing info (don't be greedy)
you'd have to edit your config
change it from '0.0.0.0' to 'your outward facing ip'


Table
abstract away sending info in cli
add peer function

fall back to server if not peers

peer
install - done
ubuntu


install python-apt and python3-apt for debian
    + To fix apt_pkg problem: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13708180/python-dev-installation-error-importerror-no-module-named-apt-pkg
    + https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1363
    + Make sure to use `apt-get` instead of `apt` to store packages in cache

Wait time is too much for daemon to respond - fetch_package - asyncio.sleep(5)
